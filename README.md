#### Create Triggers
Create a stored procedure and triggers to check a complex constraint. A stored procedure (function in postgres) which takes as input a plate, start date and end date and throws an error if table car rental contains any row with the same plate where the rental period is different from but overlaps with the given period. Triggers invoke the stored procedure created to enforce the “no duplicate rentals” constraint.
