Create Tbles
Connect to the database server and create a couple of tables.


Create Triggers
Create a stored procedure and triggers to check a complex constraint. A stored procedure (function in postgres) which takes as input a plate, start date and end date and throws an error if table car rental contains any row with the same plate where the rental period is different from but overlaps with the given period. Triggers invoke the stored procedure created to enforce the “no duplicate rentals” constraint.


ER Diagram
Create an extended Entity-Relationship diagram and translate it into an SQL database schema for managing student assessments.
